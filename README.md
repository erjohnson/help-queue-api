# Help Queue API

A bare-bones API built with [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) for storing help-tickets to a postgres db. The goal of this project is to interface with [Help Queue](https://github.com/dustinbrownman/ember-queue) and store ticket data in a normalized way in order to run queries on the data.  This project is a work-in-progress.
